# LAB-3-Engo-651
In this project, youâ€™ll learn about mashing up a styled vector tileset hosted on Mapbox with your web mapping application developed in the previous lab. Users will be able to load and visualize a different map layer (e.g., a Mapbox style) from your Mapbox account. You will use Mapbox to design and publish the map layer. Users will also be able to toggle on and off the new layer.
